The program, after receiving a value k (integer) and a string from command line, generates k threads and waits them. Each thread reads concurrently the file, and performs the sum of the read integer numbers. When the end of file is reached, it prints sum of the integer numbers it has read and terminates. After all threads terminate, the main thread prints the total sum.
